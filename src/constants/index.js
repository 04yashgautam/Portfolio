export const HERO_CONTENT = `My interests lie at the intersection of technology, creativity, and problem-solving. In addition to front-end development, I actively explore machine learning and data-driven technologies to create intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Whether itâ€™s designing a clean user interface, integrating a robust backend, or training models for insightful predictions, I enjoy every step of the development journey.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = ` A code crafter, problem solver, and digital explorer. I love bringing ideas to life through clean design, smart code, and a touch of creative flair. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, efficient solutions. From front-end development using React to back-end integration and data-driven ML models, I strive to create impactful projects that not only function well but also look great. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging tasks that push my skills further.`;
